# Cybersecurity Research & Engineering Lab
> **This github repository documents my technical specialization into Cybersecurity. It aims to servee as a transparent log of my hands on labs and certification progress, while also focusing on translating 6 years of Business Intelligence experience into the fields of Infrastructure Defense and Cloud Security Architecture.

## Projects

### [01. Linux Infrastructure Hardening](./01-linux-hardening/)
* **Focus:** Identity security (ED25519), intrusion prevention (Fail2Ban), and host firewalls (UFW).
* **Environment:** AWS EC2 (Ubuntu 24.04 ARM64).
* **Key Outcome:** Transitioned a default cloud instance to a hardened baseline with a "Deny-All" perimeter.

### 02. VPC Network Segmentation (Coming Soon)
* **Focus:** Network ACLs, Private Subnets, and Identity-based access (EICE).
* **Goal:** Building a 3-tier architecture with zero public internet exposure.

## Skills & Tools
* **Cloud:** AWS (EC2, IAM, Security Groups)
* **Linux:** Ubuntu Server, Bash, UFW, Fail2Ban
* **Security:** Principle of Least Privilege, Zero Trust Architecture, SSH Hardening
